# tfs_workitems_to_gitlab_issues

PowerShell script to migrate TFS work items to GitLab Issues

### Prerequisites

1. Install TFS (tfx-cli) and GilLab (glab) cli where this is running (ie: action or locally)
2. In GitLab, [create a label](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#create-a-label) for EACH work item type that is being migrated (as lower case) 
    - ie: "user story", "bug", "task", "issue", "feature"
3. Define under what area path you want to migrate
    - You can modify the WIQL if you want to use a different way to migrate work items, such as `[TAG] = "migrate"`

### Things it migrates

1. Title
2. Description (or for a bug, repro steps and/or system info)
3. State (if the work item is done / closed, it will be closed in GitLab)
4. It will try to assign the work item to the correct user in GitLab - based on TFS email before the `@`
    - This uses the `-gl_update_assigned_to` and `-gl_assigned_to_user_suffix` options
    - Users have to be added to GitLab
5. Migrate acceptance criteria as part of issue body (if present)
6. Adds in the following as a comment to the issue:
    - Original work item url 
    - Basic details in a collapsed markdown table
    - Entire work item as JSON in a collapsed section
7. Creates tag "copied-to-gitlab" and a comment on the TFS work item with `-$tfs_production_run $true"`. The tag prevents duplicate copying.

### To Do
1. Provide user mapping option
2. Debug the tfs_workitems_to_gitlab_issues.ps1
3. Debug the .gitlab\workflows\migrate-work-items.yml

### Things it won't ever migrate
1. Created date/update dates

## Instructions for Running in Actions

<!-- The recommendation is to use a GitLab App to run the migration - a GitLab app has higher rate limits than using a user PAT. -->

1. Create GitLab project with. Use the following permissions:
    + Repo: `Contents:Read`
    + Repo: `Issues:Read and write`
    + Repo: `Members:Read`
1. Create Private Key for GitLab project
1. Obtain project group name and project name
<!-- 1. Create the following action secrets:
    + `ADO_PAT`: Azure DevOps PAT with appropriate permissions to read work items
    + `PRIVATE_KEY`: The contents of the private key created and downloaded in step #2 -->
1. Use the [action](.github/workflows/migrate-work-items.yml) and update the group and project name obtained in step #3
<!-- 1. Update any defaults in the [action](.gitlab/workflows/migrate-work-items.yml) (ie: TFS team and project, GitLab project/repo) -->
1. Ensure the action exists in the repo's default branch
1. Run the workflow

## Instructions for Running Locally

Using the GitLab project might be better so you don't reach a limit on your GitLab account on creating new issues ðŸ˜€

```pwsh
./tfs_workitems_to_gitlab_issues.ps1 `
    -tfs_username "xxx" `
    -tfs_password "***" `
    -tfs_url "http://tfs:8080/tfs/TFSProjectCollection" `
    -tfs_project "TailWindTraders" `
    -tfs_team "TailWindTraders Team" `
    -tfs_area_path "TailWindTraders\AREA_PATH_LEVEL_1\AREA_PATH_LEVEL_2\..." `
    -tfs_migrate_closed_workitems $true `
    -tfs_production_run $false `
    -gl_group "MainGroup" `
    -gl_project "MyProject" `
    -gl_update_assigned_to $true `
    -gl_assigned_to_user_suffix "" `
    -gl_add_tfs_comments $true
```
